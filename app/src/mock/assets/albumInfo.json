In a press release, Eminem explained that he and Dr. Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music and thus, \"Putting out Relapse 2 will let everyone get all of the best stuff.\" According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 will be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview Eminem also confirmed \"It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it.\" On June 25, 2009 Eminem called into Shade 45 and said he was in the studio finishing up Relapse 2 and expected a release during the fourth quarter of 2009, with Rolling Stone magazine slating the album for a November 2009 release date, but in November 2009, he stated that he would re-release Relapse, with extra songs, to hold fans over for the release of Relapse 2  in 2010.\n\nIn another Shade 45 interview, Eminem explained that the album was more \"emotionally driven\" than the first Relapse record, which was, as he explains \"[just] rap records\".\n\nWhen premiering the debut single, Eminem also let listeners know that there weren't any skits on the album, so the album would contain more songs than his previous studio albums. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/Recovery\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
